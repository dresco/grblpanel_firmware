         This is a number >= 1 that determines the maximum encoder count
         before value wraps around to zero.

         Quadrature encoder mode:
         1: x2 mode - counts up/down on TI1FP1 edge depending on TI2FP2 level
         2: x2 mode - counts up/down on TI2FP2 edge depending on TI1FP1 level
         3: x4 mode - counts up/down on both TI1FP1 and TI2FP2 edges depending on the level of the other input

       description: |
         Intensity of the filter applied to the input signal. This is
         implemented by scaling the sampling frequency and adding a counter
         in which N consecutive samples with same value are needed to validate
         a transition.
         Mapping is as follows (F_clk is the timer's clock):
         0: No filter, sampling is done at F_dts (default value)
         1: Fs = F_clk, N=2
         2: Fs = F_clk, N=4
         3: Fs = F_clk, N=8
         4: Fs = F_clk/2, N=6
         5: Fs = F_clk/2, N=8
         6: Fs = F_clk/4, N=6
         7: Fs = F_clk/4, N=8
         8: Fs = F_clk/8, N=6
         9: Fs = F_clk/8, N=8
         10: Fs = F_clk/16, N=5
         11: Fs = F_clk/16, N=6
         12: Fs = F_clk/16, N=8
         13: Fs = F_clk/32, N=5
         14: Fs = F_clk/32, N=6
         15: Fs = F_clk/32, N=8
         Default value is set by hardware at reset
       default: 0
